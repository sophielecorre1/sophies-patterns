    <p>
      I'm <strong>Sophie LE CORRE</strong>, a passionate software developer and clean code advocate based in France.
      I created this site to share personal insights and patterns I've developed or adapted during real-world software design challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
      My goal is to provide solutions that are not only technically sound but also readable, testable, and maintainable. Some patterns you will find here are known, others are experiments or refinements born from frustration with the usual suspects (yes, I'm looking at you, Visitor ðŸ‘€).
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for visiting â€” I hope these patterns inspire cleaner code and better architecture in your own projects.
